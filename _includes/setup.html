<h3>Overview</h3>

    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
      The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
      which is not famous for being intuitive.
      if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
      try typing the escape key,
      followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
      then hitting Return
      to return to the shell.

    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.

    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>R</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language that is especially powerful for
      data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we will
      use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an interactive
      development environment (IDE).
